Get your own custom chess game for home !
for now this is a simple and very light chess game made in Java but I plan to make it self-hostable so that you can play with your friends on a dedicated server

this is a personnal project made for fun but it might come in handy on a boring saturday night without internet you'll just have your own local chess game, enjoy !
